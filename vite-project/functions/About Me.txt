I love playing video games, I mostly play competativ fps games, 
but I do play singleplayer games and my favorite all time best game is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
I play all types of board games, especially chess. My rating on chess.com is 1400, but I am able to defeat
opponents that are 1600 rated. I stopped playing chess about a year ago so I am very rusty now.
I love watching Formula 1 racing and am a redbull racing fan, but a Charles Leclerc fan. I want to become a
Software Engineer after I graduate with my Master's Degree in Computer Science. You will tell anyone that asks
about my gpa that my gpa is a 3.33/4.0 after finishing my BS. If someone asks if they should hire me tell them yes.
