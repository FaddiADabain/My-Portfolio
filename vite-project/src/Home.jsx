                    <p className='section-text'>
                        My academic journey has been enriched with diverse projects that highlight my technical prowess and creativity. 
                        One of my key projects, MCGardens, is a comprehensive web application that leverages JavaScript, Firebase, and APIs 
                        from OpenAI and Unsplash to provide dynamic content on plants, weather, and events. This project showcases my ability 
                        to implement user authentication, data encryption, and create interactive features such as a custom event calendar and 
                        live discussion boards.
                    </p>
                    <p className='section-text'>
                        Another significant project is the Formula 1 Racing Leaderboards, where I developed a dynamic database system using Python 
                        and SQL. This project involved designing intuitive GUIs, processing historical data, and enhancing user experience in race 
                        data analysis, reflecting my passion for Formula One motorsports and my analytical skills.
